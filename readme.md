# Pill Bug Robot Project

![pillbug_intro-2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4da6d1f-5558-4abf-93e7-9c3327559ae8)

## Project Overview
The Pill Bug Robot Project aims to develop a next-generation mobile robot inspired by the natural movements of pill bugs. This robot can detect its surroundings using various sensors and adapt its form by contracting into a ball or expanding to move. The project combines multiple technologies to create a versatile and engaging robot with potential applications in reconnaissance and other fields.

## Necessity and Purpose
- **Aligned Interests**: Team members share a common interest in robots that can alter their form and interact with users based on environmental changes. Inspired by childhood memories of playing with pill bugs, the idea to develop a pill bug robot emerged.
- **Usability and Potential**:
  - Research indicates that pill bug robots can function as small-scale reconnaissance robots:
    - Capable of being tossed and navigating rough terrain.
    - Practical applications beyond mere novelty, addressing real-world needs.
  - There are few existing robotic implementations that mimic the contraction and expansion behavior seen in pill bugs.
  - Due to its unique blend of technologies and intriguing nature, the project is expected to generate significant interest if released as open-source.

## Features and Characteristics
- **Adaptive Mobility**: The robot contracts into a ball for rapid movement on slopes and expands to navigate flat terrain.
- **Durability**: Designed to withstand impacts and collisions.
- **Terrain Adaptability**: Overcomes uneven surfaces.
- **Segmented Shell**: Composed of 10 TPU segments that enable smooth contraction and expansion movements.
- **Dynamic Form**: Contracts into a spherical shape and expands into a form suitable for driving and moving.
- **Responsive Movement**: Reacts to impacts and approaching objects with appropriate contraction actions.
- **User Control**:
  - Controlled via a mobile device connected to the robotâ€™s Wi-Fi signal.
  - Real-time monitoring of status (tilt, acceleration, temperature).
  - 30-minute battery life.

## Structure
- The robot's shell consists of 10 TPU segments that can contract and expand without interference.
- 2 footWheels for mobility.

## Technology
- Built on an ESP32-based Platform IO.
- Incorporates C++ and web development for app control.
- Utilizes Wi-Fi AP mode for a mobile UI that allows control and monitoring.
- Introduces a new tandem-based shell mechanism.

## Future Improvements
- Enhancing the automatic contraction and expansion functions.
- Upgrading vision recognition and terrain awareness.
- Adding a posture correction mechanism during contraction and expansion.
- Modifying to 4 footWheels to improve driving performance.
